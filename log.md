# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learned from Sunshine

**Thoughts:** I went over a few early exercises with the Sunshine app to make sense of my own. There’s still a lot that I don’t understand, but as I read more code I think to myself, “Ohhh... so THAT’S how you do that.” Right now, I’ve got a basic setup with an EditText and a search button. I don’t think I’ll do anything fancy with this app except for maybe adding a spinner to change the number of results that appear. I do, however, think I’ll complete the rest of the Sunshine module so I understand the process more.

### Day 6: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** You'll find what you're looking for if you look hard enough.

**Thoughts:** I went into today with the idea that I was overcomplicating things. Udacity likes to stretch you, but nothing more than they think you can handle. So, I decided to look through other Udacity courses to find the Sunshine app. Initially, when I started courses, I saw it as this giant app that would teach you a huge assortment of skills. But, the Nanodegree does the same thing and it keeps me more accountable to learn since I have to pay for it. After perusing through for a while, I found a section that broke down the AsyncTask, a few other heavy topics, and gave examples to work on. I feel better now. Time to take a break and enjoy life.

### Day 5: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Mooore Research

**Thoughts:** I think I'm onto something with searching through JSON by keywords, but I haven't tested anything out. Even though it hasn't been covered yet, I think I might need to jump ahead a few lessons and store the books in a SQLite database and search from there. This reminds me of when I had a Dictionary project in college. I can't remember if it actually compiled or not (probably not). Reading data from various sources seems to be a reoccurring roadblock. Could this be a setup?

### Day 4: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Research

**Thoughts:** I'm collecting resources to work on my Book Listing app. I've got a similiar project to work from, so if I can figure out how to search through that, then I know I can apply it to what I need to submit.

### Day 3: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** LoaderManager

**Thoughts:** I tried to take a shortcut in learning how LoaderManager outperforms AsyncTask, but I didn't know enough about AsyncTask to do it. What I need to do... what I've been dreading to do, even though I know it has proven itself to work... is write it down. From start to finish, I have to map out the path the URL travels as I parse JSON, and create lists. From there, I can learn how to add the ability to search the app, then I can start on my own project.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I learned I need to learn about ArrayList

**Thoughts:** I had to make some major changes to the Quake Report, and I thought I knew what was going on, but nah... I had reached a point where I could get the program to compile, but I was left with a blank app. I think I'll make tomorrow a Java day. I need to hit the Jym*.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on JSON parsing and AsyncTask in the Quake Report app

**Thoughts:** I get it, but I don’t get it. I think I’m calling the right methods (because it compiles), but I need to re-add the ListView I had before so everything appears… and not crash
