# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on JSON parsing and AsyncTask in the Quake Report app

**Thoughts:** I get it, but I don’t get it. I think I’m calling the right methods (because it compiles), but I need to re-add the ListView I had before so everything appears… and not crash
