# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 43: February 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Project X

**Thoughts:** I spent the better half of the day going through each step of the Pets app (demo of how databases work), and now I’m working on my own. There’s a few elements that I’m going to implement into my own project, but I think I want to see if I can add something extra - you know, to spice things up. It won’t give me any credit, but I think it will be a benefit to my final app due next month. It’s weird. There are times where I work on projects and I draw a blank on how to get things started, and there are times where my fingers do all the talking. I think the power is in consistent practice and keeping my mind open to all the tools around me.

I’ve also been working on how I write my GitHub commits. I really want that to be a skill that I don’t have to think about.

### Day 42: February 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Back at Udacity

**Thoughts:** This intro to databases doesn’t seem too difficult, so I want to go through the right way step-by-step to make sure I understand what needs to go where, and the best practices to be able to test it. Learning about Contracts and the SQLiteOpenHelper really opened my eyes to how not-difficult things are. I don’t want to say easy because I know I couldn’t just throw up either methods off the top of my head, but at the same time it’s not impossible or beyond my skill.

### Day 41: February 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Old Concepts

**Thoughts:** I spent the day reading my old Java book and refreshing myself on basic concepts. My initial reaction to programming is to create one giant class, and I wanted to break my mind out of that box by figuring out how one decides how to separate thoughts into classes. It’s really silly, but it is a habit I want to work on.

### Day 40: February 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Kotlin

**Thoughts:** After my Android meetup I decided that I want to try my hands at working with Kotlin. A part of me feels like a baby learning multiple languages at the same time and confusing syntax. I also tried doing this while riding in a car. I don't know if it was because my side was heated to 80+ degrees, or if staring at a screen while riding gives me motion sickness, but my brain could not handle it. I think after my Nanodegree break I'll try and see if I can manually convert some programs into Kotlin.

### Day 39: February 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Android Meetup

**Thoughts:** I went to my first Android meetup today. I really enjoy the CodeNewbie community, but I knew I also needed something more specific to what I was studying. I believe the group meets up once a month to go over best practices and to share stories and “gotcha moments” when programming. 

I ended up meeting another developer, Suree (sp? - so sorry), who works on a cruise app, and we ended up chatting it up about bootcamps, the fears of networking, and few other topics. For once, although I was surrounded by actual developers, I didn’t feel intimidated. This will definitely be a great resource for my journey.

I even reached out to [one of the presenters](https://twitter.com/AOrobator) and now I’m going to try my hands at Kotlin.

### Day 38: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Udacity Part II

**Thoughts:** Not much changed from the day before.

### Day 37: February 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Udacity

**Thoughts:** Today I pretty much went through a long list of videos to understand how data persistence and Android function together. I don’t fully get it, but I think if I rewatch everything a few times (maybe watch it once, then watch it again and follow along) and do the program exactly as they do it, it should start making sense. Then I would have a tangible example and I can modify from there.

### Day 36: February 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Practice

**Thoughts:** Working through the Codecademy tutorials seemed like a real easy way to work through databases. I think it was good for me to separate the Android from the database, just so that I had a good understanding of how they worked on their own.

### Day 35: February 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** SQLite

**Thoughts:** I finally got to the section of the Nanodegree where they introduce databases. I've always been curious about data persistence and here's my chance to check it out. Even more important, the fun teachers are guiding this part of the course. I felt like that last bit was a very dry topic, taught by dry people (no offense). However, they did stretch my mind to figuring out the hardest aspects of loaders and asynchronus processes. I'll give them that…

I’m debating on if I should head over to Codecademy and work on the SQL course, or if what I’ll learn in the tutorial will be sufficient. I think the right thing to do is to always get more information if possible. So after I finish the two sections in this course, I’ll head over and strengthen the foundation. I should probably take a look at SharedPreferences as well.

### Day 34: February 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

**Thoughts:** I turned my project in today. I was expecting to get it rejected. I think it passed because I technically fulfilled all of the requirements. I needed a list. I needed to parse data from the Guardian api. And, I needed to use a Loader instead of an AsyncTask. Since I did all of that. I guess that fact that my app had one bug (annoying to me probably more than anything else) wasn’t such a big deal. I also got some great advice to rewrite other aspects more efficiently. 

After this Nanodegree, I think I’m going to take between a couple of weeks to a month to work solely on Java. Right now my Java is just passable. I feel like I’m not really understanding what I’m using, but at the same time I would have to understand it to a degree in order to use it in the first place. I’ll likely use a mix of my old book, hopefully an online resource, and a few websites like HackerRank and CodeWars for problem solving. 

I feel very serious about this developer thing, so I need to get in as much practice as possible. After my Java training, I’ll enroll into the Android Developer Nanodegree Plus and hopefully earn a job in the end.

### Day 33: February 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** It Works! (kinda)

**Thoughts:** So, I've got my app pretty much where I want it. A user can type in a word or phrase and find news articles relating to it, and if they click an article from the list, it will take them to the webpage to read more about it. The only problem that I have is that the app will crash if you return to the app after checking out an article. Totally not supposed to happen, but hey, it’s a start. It’s due on Sunday, so I’ve got some time to check my code and find some best practices when it comes to loaders and asynctasks. I think a well placed method on the background thread is really all I need.

### Day 32: February 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Bird by Bird

**Thoughts:** I'm taking it back with solving small problems before I just jump in and throw some code in. For a while, I thought I needed to create an detailed activity view of my list item, but it looks like I only need to open the article. So, the first thing I decided to do was to see if I knew the position of the list item. I figure if I know that, I can create a way to generate the necessary url to take the user to the article they want. I also need to add a few more things, but I'm just looking for the MVP right now. I can clean it up later after it all works.

### Day 31: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Coders Block

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm in this weird zone where I don't know what to do. I know what I "want" to happen. I've actually done it in an earlier app. But, I'm not sure as to how to go about it with this one. A part of me feels like I need to take a break, and the other part feels like I'm not thinking creatively enough. Not totally sure who is going to win that particular battle. My project is due on the 12th. All I need to do is create a detailed view for my list items to open into. I did it once in my New York app. The only difference is that I knew ahead of time how many list items I would have.

On the plus side, I’ve started using branches in the built-in Android Terminal. I’m on my way to be a Git/GitHub master - if there’s such a thing.

### Day 30: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Intents

**Thoughts:** I've been dealing with a slight mental block, so I decided to see how to implement intents in the best way into my app. That led me to realize that I needed an adapter, and that led me to realize that I needed more practice.

### Day 29: February 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Rotate It

**Thoughts:** I was trying out several ways to see how to get my app to rotate and retain all of the information. Android destroys and recreates the activity on rotation, which is fine, but as a user it would make someone leave your app for another one.

### Day 28: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Exercise

**Thoughts:** Didn't have a real project goal in mind, so I tried a few Java exercises to get my mind going. Probably made it worse.

### Day 27: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** My brain hurts

**Thoughts:** There's a part of me that feels that I'm just following instructions versus actually coding (which I think is actually the case). I would like to be able to whip methods out of thin air, but I think I'm surrounded by too many unknown unknowns. I think I'll take a project break and work on some general Java exercises.

### Day 26: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I mean, it works

**Thoughts:** After I made my branch yesterday, I took some time out to write what I wanted to type by hand. I read a part of a program to understand how data traveled through it, and went to my own to see where I could do better. I was quite happy to notice that I didn't have any weird errors. The only thing my Loader doesn't do, is save my data when I rotate the screen. So, once I fix that, I can merge that branch and start a new one where I implement the SearchView for the first time.

It's a good feeling to see how far I came. I literally tried my first Android course on a whim, and now I'm almost done with the Nanodegree. From there I will hopefully get into the Android Developer Nanodegree, and work on some really awesome projects. I already have an idea for my final project. 

Keep moving forward.

### Day 25: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Branches aka Young Hashirama

**Thoughts:** A little while ago I started looking at the several windows at the bottom of Android Studio. There's Run, TODO, Terminal, Version Control, and a few others, but the only two I ever paid attention to were Run - because I need to know what's happening as I run my program, and TODO - because it puts my exercises in a nice list for me. I saw Terminal but I never gave it much thought. I didn't really see the value in it at first because I would use the actual Terminal to connect my project to my repository. Then randomly yesterday, I thought to myself, "What if I can use it to make branches?" Why would I want to make branches? Well, I wanted to get myself into the habit of actually using version control, instead of using commented out code to make adjustsments. This is all pretty new to me. When I took my Java courses in college, there was no talk of Git, or any form of version control. My first and favorite professor expected us to start everything by hand. My second instructor put us in groups had us head straight for the computer.

In my News App, I got it to the point where it worked with an AsyncTask, and instead of commenting out a bunch of code, I thought it would just be smarter (and better practice) to use the technology in front of me. I took Udacity's Git course a few months back, but only really used it to commit changes, and at one point I would commit the whole project at the end when I completed it. Now I'm slowly weaving it into my daily habits so I can be of some service if I ever plan to make it as a developer, or a mentor to someone else.

### Day 24: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Nothing much

**Thoughts:** I really didn't do too much today. I had this crazy idea that I could easily refactor my AsyncTask into an AsyncTaskLoader, but that wasn't the case. It's probably due to the way that I coded it in the first place. I wish I had those Ironman holograms, you know the ones where he could view and slim down his armor. I need that for code. I wonder if people cut strips of their code and move them around to try out new things. I wonder what I should call it. Snippet building? Snippr? Snip Coding?

### Day 23: January 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** ???

**Thoughts:** I had a 1-1 with a Udacity mentor to go over my project. I was trying to figure out why my Book Listing app worked, but not my News app with seemingly the same code. The solution happened to be a minor flub with a HashMap. I was basically assigning a value to a String when I should have assigned it to a key. At least now it’s working. It’s time to shake things up and break it all over again.

### Day 22: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Blank Bot

**Thoughts:** I stopped earlier than I normally would in the morning. I got blocked by a blank listview that I couldn't wrap my head around. It's actually something I came in contact with a long time ago, but for whatever reason, it seems like a different scenario. So, I decided to just stop, reach out to a Udacity mentor, and we will go over it the next day. 

I started reading the blog post [Being A Developer After 40](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/being-a-developer-after-40-3c5dd112210c#.9of99l8j3) and I tried to make my first bot. The bot part didn't work out so well, but I think I just need to give it some time and another shot.

### Day 21: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Wrong Window

**Thoughts:** I decided to finally put some code down, and I was looking to trace why my JSON strings wouldn't appear. Hours later, after a break, after dinner, I realized I was looking at the wrong window. Smh.

### Day 20: January 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Api Key

**Thoughts:** Today I went to a cryptoparty to see if they had a special workshop for journalists and what not. I'm not a journalist, but I thought it would be interesting to learn new digital tricks to keep myself safe out there in the digital world. Since it's also a place where people work on projects, I decided to work on mine, and I came across an article on how to [hide api keys](http://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-hide-your-api-key-in-android-600583/). It's probably not totally necessary right now, but I do see the value in learning how to do it. The Saturday cryptos are probably the best resource for me to figure out and try new things with folks, but I do feel a little intimidated because their minds and fingers are on a whole other level.

Subconsciously that’s probably why I go - to get pulled up.

### Day 19: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Loaders

**Thoughts:** I've been thinking a lot about Loaders lately. I haven't used one yet, so I started looking for tutorials >>[CP](http://www.concretepage.com/android/android-asynctaskloader-example-with-listview-and-baseadapter). I've also entertained the idea of starting my project with an AsyncTask and then turning it into an AsyncTaskLoader. It's probably unnecessary, so the right thing to do would be 1) try a few tutorials, and 2) draft how my project fits in with it. In some ways I still feel a bit illiterate when it comes to reading from the [developer page](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/AsyncTaskLoader.html), so it’s not always the best resource for me.

It’s on my to-learn list.

### Day 18: January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Git

**Thoughts:** I'm really interested in making myself more comfortable using git & GitHub, so I took a quick [Codecademy](codecademy.com) lesson. I think what makes it a bit tougher is that Android Studio is integrated with GitHub. I really only need to connect the project that I'm working on to the repository and after that, I'm pretty much done. So far, I haven't had a reason to make new branches, or reset anything. This probably means I need to pickup another main language to play around with to get more practice.

### Day 17: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** News App Shell

**Thoughts:** I think I understand how to go about this app, but it does have a few slight particulars for me to understand first. It will do me good to focus on building small projects dealing with Loaders, SearchViews and a JSON class, to get a full understanding of what needs to happen before I start spewing code out.

### Day 16: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Moving Forward

**Thoughts:** After four reviews, we got the project approved. This next project is quite similar to the Book Listing, only it requires the more upgraded methods/classes that I was trying to skip ahead and learn from before. Loaders are coming to town. And, now that we know about them, Empty States are coming to town - the real kind (#NoTextViews). I'm going to get my code skeleton together, and start drawing out how I want this to look. Let's see if I can get a nice MVP going before January ends.

### Day 15: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Project II

**Thoughts:** I made some changes to my project to display an empty view when no results of books appear. As I work more and more on these projects, you learn the details are truly important. It's amazing all of the work that goes into an app (including the ones that don't work). I honestly can't tell which is tougher between the logic or the UI/UX. I've probably submitted my project three times already, but it's really this kind of feedback that pushes you to think different. I'm not just making an app for myself, I need to always consider a larger mixed audience. The next thing I should be picky about is how I want my READMEs to look. I think it would do some good to go through my repos and make things all pretty-like.

Oh, I added a link that my reviewer sent me that's dedicated to Empty States.

### Day 14: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Project

**Thoughts:** I spent the day working on my Project. I did an initial submission with what I had just to see where I was at with the specifications (I went into it knowing I would need to resubmit it later). I think it would be good for me to get involved with something similar. I remember when I took my first Java class and my professor created a Java lab where we would fix bugs in each other's code. I don't think anything accelerated my learning more than that.

Bugs are friends, not food.

### Day 13: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** ListView

**Thoughts:** In the beginning of the day, I had this issue where I would search for a book, and then the new results would show up on top of the old ones. I didn't really see that as a problem at first until I made some unspecified change and the newer results started showing up on the bottom of the book. That made it quite tough for testing, especially since I didn’t know what was going on at first. That led me to finding out a way to clear the list each time a new search is made. I thought just making the adapter null would do the trick, but I was placing the statements in the wrong place. Eventually I found a stackoverflow post that put me in the right direction and that was the end of it. I’m beginning to think there aren’t any real coders. There’s just the imaginary beings of Stackoverflow.

### Day 12: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Plain

**Thoughts:** Ever since I did my last project with more features than necessary, I've been going back and forth with the idea to make this app plain. It's only asking for the author's name and the title of the book. Even in the instructions, the main focus is the Java aspect. I'll figure out something nice.

### Day 11: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I am one with the Log, and the Log is with me.

**Thoughts:** I finally got something to display on my app. I literally sat down, recreated a tutorial that I knew worked, and threw a bunch of log lines in so I could know what to expect to know my code was working. From there, I just did baby steps. Get the root. Make the object. Loop the array. This was soooo TOUGH! But, I was very persistent in getting the job done. I'm very proud. I still need to understand how to go about getting the "authors", but I will take this as a win for the day and relax. Also, I think this would be a good time to remove a lot of the commented out code I have. They didn't teach me git back in the day, so I have this silly fear of losing important lines unknowingly.

**Today's Progress:** I got JSONned...

**Thoughts:** Not much progress today but I think I'm getting the hang of what I'm putting down. I'm just a few days away before I have to turn this project in. This is going to be interesting...

**Today's Progress:** S.D.W.

**Thoughts:** Ummm... still trying to make things work. This is probably the worst commit ever, but I pushed it as a lesson to myself. Still don't know what's going on, but we will try again. I've got some Sunshine app madness woven in - don't judge me.

### Day 8: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Bird by Bird

**Thoughts:** I have unsuccessfully tried to jump ahead my learning without filling in the holes. I’m looking around at all of these different classes and methods like, “???”. So, I need to do myself justice by working each exercise, and reading the comments so I know why things are/aren’t best practices. There’s nothing like practicing the wrong thing and assuming it’s right. Don’t do that.

Not even for the vine.

### Day 7: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learned from Sunshine

**Thoughts:** I went over a few early exercises with the Sunshine app to make sense of my own. There’s still a lot that I don’t understand, but as I read more code I think to myself, “Ohhh... so THAT’S how you do that.” Right now, I’ve got a basic setup with an EditText and a search button. I don’t think I’ll do anything fancy with this app except for maybe adding a spinner to change the number of results that appear. I do, however, think I’ll complete the rest of the Sunshine module so I understand the process more.

### Day 6: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** You'll find what you're looking for if you look hard enough.

**Thoughts:** I went into today with the idea that I was overcomplicating things. Udacity likes to stretch you, but nothing more than they think you can handle. So, I decided to look through other Udacity courses to find the Sunshine app. Initially, when I started courses, I saw it as this giant app that would teach you a huge assortment of skills. But, the Nanodegree does the same thing and it keeps me more accountable to learn since I have to pay for it. After perusing through for a while, I found a section that broke down the AsyncTask, a few other heavy topics, and gave examples to work on. I feel better now. Time to take a break and enjoy life.

### Day 5: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Mooore Research

**Thoughts:** I think I'm onto something with searching through JSON by keywords, but I haven't tested anything out. Even though it hasn't been covered yet, I think I might need to jump ahead a few lessons and store the books in a SQLite database and search from there. This reminds me of when I had a Dictionary project in college. I can't remember if it actually compiled or not (probably not). Reading data from various sources seems to be a reoccurring roadblock. Could this be a setup?

### Day 4: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Research

**Thoughts:** I'm collecting resources to work on my Book Listing app. I've got a similiar project to work from, so if I can figure out how to search through that, then I know I can apply it to what I need to submit.

### Day 3: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** LoaderManager

**Thoughts:** I tried to take a shortcut in learning how LoaderManager outperforms AsyncTask, but I didn't know enough about AsyncTask to do it. What I need to do... what I've been dreading to do, even though I know it has proven itself to work... is write it down. From start to finish, I have to map out the path the URL travels as I parse JSON, and create lists. From there, I can learn how to add the ability to search the app, then I can start on my own project.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I learned I need to learn about ArrayList

**Thoughts:** I had to make some major changes to the Quake Report, and I thought I knew what was going on, but nah... I had reached a point where I could get the program to compile, but I was left with a blank app. I think I'll make tomorrow a Java day. I need to hit the Jym*.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on JSON parsing and AsyncTask in the Quake Report app

**Thoughts:** I get it, but I don’t get it. I think I’m calling the right methods (because it compiles), but I need to re-add the ListView I had before so everything appears… and not crash
