# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** LoaderManager

**Thoughts:** I tried to take a shortcut in learning how LoaderManager outperforms AsyncTask, but I didn't know enough about AsyncTask to do it. What I need to do... what I've been dreading to do, even though I know it has proven itself to work... is write it down. From start to finish, I have to map out the path the URL travels as I parse JSON, and create lists. From there, I can learn how to add the ability to search the app, then I can start on my own project.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I learned I need to learn about ArrayList

**Thoughts:** I had to make some major changes to the Quake Report, and I thought I knew what was going on, but nah... I had reached a point where I could get the program to compile, but I was left with a blank app. I think I'll make tomorrow a Java day. I need to hit the Jym*.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on JSON parsing and AsyncTask in the Quake Report app

**Thoughts:** I get it, but I don’t get it. I think I’m calling the right methods (because it compiles), but I need to re-add the ListView I had before so everything appears… and not crash
